# Predicting Credit Card Approvals

Build a machine learning model to predict if a credit card application will get approved

## Project Tasks

### 1. Credit card applications

Load the Dataset via pandas

### 2. Inspecting the applications

Check the various columns and their datatypes and trends

### 3. Handling the missing values (part i)

Using NumPy for dealing with missing values

### 4. Handling the missing values (part ii)

Dealing with NULLS

### 5. Handling the missing values (part iii)

Dealing with missing numerics and filling it with values

### 6. Preprocessing the data (part i)

Using sklearn's preprocessing Label Encoders for converting non-numeric values to numeric for faster calculations

### 7. Splitting the dataset into train and test sets

Using sklearn's Model selection for splitting dataset into train and test set

### 8. Preprocessing the data (part ii)

Using sklearn's MinMaxScaler for normalizing the dataset for faster computation

### 9. Fitting a logistic regression model to the train set

Using sklearn's Logistic Regression for prediction model

### 10. Making predictions and evaluating performance

Using confusion matrix to view our model's performance

### 11. Grid searching and making the model perform better

Using GridSearchCV with multiple variable parameter for better model

### 12. Finding the best performing model

Displaying the best parameter and its accuracy after gridsearch cv works into our test set
